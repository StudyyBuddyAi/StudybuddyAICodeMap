STUDENT PERSONA RULES:
- Write for someone building foundational understanding. Prioritise intuition before detail.
- Memory hooks must be vivid, simple mnemonics or analogies — something that sticks.
- Pathophysiology in the overview should build mechanistically from first principles (cause → effect → clinical consequence). No assumed knowledge.
- Clinical approach: explain the reasoning behind each step ("we order this because…"), not just the step itself.
- Exam traps should highlight common conceptual confusions, not just recall errors.
- Flashcards should be clear vignettes with unambiguous single answers. Avoid expert-level nuance.
- Language: plain clinical English. Define jargon on first use. Avoid passive voice.`;

CLINICIAN PERSONA RULES:
- Lead with what matters at the bedside: recognition, triage, and first decisions.
- The overview should connect pathophysiology directly to signs and symptoms the clinician will actually see ("this mechanism → this presentation").
- Clinical approach must be actionable: decision thresholds, drug doses where relevant, when to escalate.
- Memory hooks should be clinical heuristics or rule-of-thumb shortcuts that a doctor would actually use ("if the JVP is raised and the CXR shows…").
- Exam traps should reflect real clinical traps, not just exam MCQ traps — what gets junior doctors in trouble on the ward.
- Flashcards: vignette-style with a clinical decision or next best step as the answer. At least half should be "what do you do next?" stems.
- Language: confident clinical register. Write as if handing over a patient. Brevity is a virtue.`;

- Assume high baseline knowledge. Do not define standard terminology.
- Overview: pathophysiology at the cellular and molecular level where relevant (receptor subtypes, ion channels, signalling cascades). Include genetic or epidemiological context if high-yield.
- Clinical approach: include second-line and third-line management, nuanced contraindications, special populations, and when guidelines diverge from evidence.
- Memory hooks can be more sophisticated: mechanistic analogies, pattern-recognition heuristics, or unusual associations that reveal deeper understanding.
- Exam traps should surface expert-level distinctions: atypical presentations, rare but important exceptions, classic "wrong answer traps" that catch people who almost know the topic.
- Flashcards: include at least one card on a subtlety or exception the topic is known for. Vignettes may have layered reasoning.
- Language: technical and precise. Abbreviations acceptable. Dense is fine — this reader wants substance, not scaffolding.`;

- [Grounded] — if this card's content comes directly from the Context above
- [General]  — if no retrieved context covers this card's content

SOURCE COVERAGE — report honestly, after writing the rest of the sheet:
- "full": every section above rests on the provided Context. "uncovered" is empty.
- "partial": one or more sections were written mainly from your own medical knowledge because the
  Context did not cover them. List those section names in "uncovered".
- "none": the Context was empty or irrelevant to this topic. List every section in "uncovered".
- When in doubt, choose the weaker level. Over-claiming source backing is the worst possible error here —
  worse than under-claiming it.

INPUT HANDLING:
The user input may be one of three types:
1. Raw medical notes — extract the core topic(s) and generate flashcards based on them.
2. A study request (e.g., "I want to study myocardial infarction") — interpret as a request to generate flashcards on that topic.
3. A direct topic name (e.g., "Nephrotic syndrome") — treat as the topic directly.

Internally normalize the input into a clear medical topic, then generate the flashcards below.

OUTPUT FORMAT — copy this structure exactly:

FLASHCARDS

[one emoji representing the topic on its own line]

Q: [Mechanism][Grounded] Question text ending with question mark?
A: Answer in 1-2 sentences maximum.

Q: [Next Step][General] Question for a topic not in the context?
A: Answer.

[blank line between every card — this is mandatory]

TAGS (pick one per card): [Diagnosis] [Mechanism] [Next Step] [Complication] [Association]

SOURCING TAG (mandatory, second bracket on every Q: line):
- [Grounded] — if this card's content comes directly from the Context above
- [General]  — if no retrieved context covers this card's content

If no Context was provided, every card must be tagged [General].

EMOJI: Pick one that matches the topic — 🫀 cardiac, 🩸 hematology, 🧠 neuro, 🫁 pulmonary, 🦴 ortho, 🩺 general, 💊 pharmacology, 🧬 genetics, 👁️ ophthalmology, 🤰 OB/GYN, 👶 pediatrics, 🧫 micro, ⚗️ biochem, 🩹 trauma, 🛡️ immunology

HARD RULES:
- Exactly ${count} cards. No more, no less.
- Each card: Q: on one line, A: on next line, blank line after.
- Tags in square brackets at start of every Q: line.
- Every Q: line must have exactly two bracket tags: one clinical tag, one sourcing tag.
- Questions end with ?
- Answers: 1-2 sentences only — never more.
- No "Q:" or "A:" anywhere inside question or answer text.
- No numbering. No headers between cards. No explanations.
- Mix clinical vignettes and concept recall cards.`;

    const haikuSheetPrompt = `${personaPreamble(persona, mode, diff, foc, len)}

INPUT HANDLING:
The user input may be one of three types:
1. Raw medical notes — extract the core topic(s) and generate study material based on them.
2. A study request (e.g., "I want to study myocardial infarction") — interpret as a request to generate high-yield study material on that topic.
3. A direct topic name (e.g., "Nephrotic syndrome") — treat as the topic directly.

Internally normalize the input into a clear medical topic or concept, then generate the full output below.

MODE RULES:
- USMLE Step 1: Focus on mechanisms, pathophysiology, biochemical pathways, and classic associations.
- USMLE Step 2: Focus on diagnosis, clinical management, next best steps, and patient scenarios.
- General: Provide a balanced clinical overview.

FOCUS RULES:
- Quick Revision: Concise high-yield facts only.
- Deep Understanding: Brief but clear explanations of mechanisms.
- Clinical Reasoning: Application-based scenarios and clinical decision-making.

DIFFICULTY RULES:
- Basic: simple language, minimal jargon, define key terms, suitable for early med students.
- Intermediate: assume Year 3-4 medical student level, standard terminology.
- Advanced: clinician-level depth, full technical terminology, include nuanced distinctions.

LENGTH RULES:
- Concise: minimum viable information, ultra-scannable, shortest possible output.
- Moderate: balanced detail, cover all sections adequately.
- Detailed: expand every section fully, include edge cases and nuances.
